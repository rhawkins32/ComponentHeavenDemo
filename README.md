A small work-in-progress webpage filled with small and simple components. While this page has few components, it demonstrates understanding of some of the key features of Angular including dynamic web page elements; creating, testing and deploying a project hosted on Github pages; and Angular animations. My next feature I would like to explore is dynamically filling a webpage with product information.
